# 100-days-of-coding

Just make a habit of coding for a hundred days and improve my Python by following Dr. Lu's crouse
The 100 Days of Coding challenge is a commitment to code for at least one hour each day for 100 consecutive days. Your goal is to follow Dr. Lu’s Python course while doing this, focusing on improving your Python skills through consistent practice.

Here’s what your challenge might look like:

Daily Coding: You’ll code for a minimum of one hour each day, following Dr. Lu’s lessons or solving practice problems related to Python.
Topics: You’ll cover everything from basic syntax and data structures to advanced topics like object-oriented programming (OOP), algorithms, and more.
Exercises: Each day could involve completing coding exercises, small projects, or contributing to open-source projects.
Progress Tracking: Track your learning and note down areas of improvement each day to build a learning curve.
By the end of 100 days, you’ll have gained a deeper understanding of Python, improved problem-solving skills, and developed coding consistency.
